Critter Escape is a game I made where the objective is to control a player character and collect critters in order to drop them at a designated area. You only gain points when the accumulated critters are dropped off. The challenge is that there is an enemy flying around that if you get touched then you respawn losing the critters that you currently had.

Critter Escape was made in [Unity](https://unity.com/), which is a game making software. The scripts for certain aspects in the game uses [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), which is an IDE for C++.

For this project I gained experience making my own scripts from scratch as the previous assignment's scripts were already done in the textbook and we only needed to do modifications.
