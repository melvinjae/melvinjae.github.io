Manoa Market is a website made for Manoa students to sell any of their belongings to other Manoa students who may need them. Users may list an item for sale and add certain parameters to them. It uses meteor template react as a base design. 

Some of my contributions were creating the meet the team page, cleaning up any ESlint errors, populating the website with default listings with pictures, and the milestones.

My takeaways from this project was how to work as a team using GitHub and how to use milestones to slowly develop the website over a few weeks.
