<p>Having not much experience with JavaScript other than JSON, which I’m not sure are fully related, I learned a lot more than I thought I would’ve with the introduction course on freeCodeCamp. I had taken a class that used JSON and was learning about the triple equal sign(===) to signify strictly equal to and had honestly thought the professor had made a typo as the other programming languages I knew never had that. When I came across it for JavaScript, I was able to not be weirded out by it. Comparing JavaScript to the other programming languages I know such as C/C++ and Python, there’s just something about JavaScript that makes it slightly more enjoyable.</p>

<p>In my opinion I think JavaScript is a good language as it seems much neater. Everything is straight forward to me and things will go much smoother once I have more experience. Having some knowledge about other programming languages helped out a lot, though I would not mind if JavaScript was the first programming language I learned.</p>

<p>Athletic software engineering is a process that requires a student to complete a coding task within a certain time frame. This action is called Workout of the Day or “WOD” for short. I find the practice WODs to be useful as it emulates the actual environment without much risk. This style of learning is stressful because I am usually unable to collect my thoughts quickly when coding and frequently make minor mistakes that is hard to pinpoint. I honestly don’t think this style will work for me as I think of myself as a slow coder but will have a positive impact on my skills as things continue.</p>
