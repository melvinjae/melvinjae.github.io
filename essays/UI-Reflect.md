## Coding Standards
Improving coding standards is very important as it is able to format the code nicely and is easily readable, but I honestly do not think it is the number one priority technique to improve quality. In my opinion it would be something along the lines of quality of the code itself. Just having the code formatted nicely does not do much to the actual quality of the code. For me, trying to improve the flow of the code helps with my quality by trying to do things step-by-step. I have not mastered that process, but I am slowly improving with all the practice WODs. 

## ESLint with IntelliJ impressions
The first week with ESLint was a bit rough to be honest. When setting it up I had trouble doing the _npm install_ command. The command would go through but ESLint would not work the slightest. As some people in the class discord also had troubles, I tried to do some of their solutions but to no avail. It ended up working when someone figured out that renaming the files inside IntelliJ works instead of renaming it when saving it to the folder, which I had been doing prior. 

Reaching the green checkmark is a painful and tedious process for me because I am not used to spacing things out. Using JSFiddle was a better experience for me because there was a "tidy" button that does the spacing for you automatically. Also having an "error" pop up after defining a variable or function saying that it is not in use is a bit annoying because it is obvious that it is not in use because I just defined it! If there was a way to somehow have a tidy button or only show the not in use variable or function error after I try to run it then it would be a better experience. Even with all the dislikes, I think it is a good thing to have a bit of a painful time to reach the green checkmark as it requires you to format and pay attention to all the necessary syntax JavaScript has.
